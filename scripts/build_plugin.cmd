@echo off
REM Build KenshiCoop.dll with the legacy v100 (VC++ 2010) x64 toolchain on a
REM machine that has only "Windows SDK 7.1 + VC2010 SP1 compiler update" (no full
REM VS2010). We hand MSBuild a complete PATH/INCLUDE/LIB and UseEnv=true so it does
REM not rely on VS2010 registry/SDK auto-detection.
REM
REM Prereqs (see resources/BUILD_SETUP.md):
REM   - VC++ 2010 (v100) x64 compiler  (SDK 7.1 + KB2519277)
REM   - VS2022 Build Tools (for MSBuild.exe)
REM   - third_party/KenshiLib_deps (deps + Boost) and env vars set
REM   - third_party/enet/enet patched for C89 (scripts/apply_enet_patch is implicit;
REM     see third_party/enet/patches/0001-enet-c89-for-loops.patch)

REM Build configuration (Phase 1 build separation). Default = Harness, the
REM optimized TEST build that INCLUDES the scenario runner - this is what the
REM regression/manual pipeline needs. Pass "Release" to produce the shipped
REM player DLL (no scenario code); "Debug" for a dev build.
REM   Usage:  scripts\build_plugin.cmd [Harness|Release|Debug]

REM left MSBUILD on the fallback path. Fallbacks cover BuildTools and Community
