// CoopLog - tiny thread-safe file logger for KenshiCoop.
//
// Why a separate logger when KenshiLib already has DebugLog/ErrorLog?
//   * Those route into the engine's kenshi.log, which is overwritten each
//     launch and interleaved with heavy engine spam - awkward for an automated
//     test runner to evaluate.
//   * KenshiLib's UI/log helpers are NOT safe to call off the main thread,
//     whereas this logger guards a FILE* with a CRITICAL_SECTION so the net
//     thread can write too.
//
// Output is a dedicated, per-line-flushed file (so it survives a hard kill),
// with a timestamp + mode tag (HOST/JOIN) on every line. The high-level
// coopLog()/coopErr() wrappers in KenshiCoop.cpp call BOTH this and the
// KenshiLib helpers, so events still appear in kenshi.log as before.
